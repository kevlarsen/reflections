When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you would want a backup copy offsite, or collaborate between many
    different people online

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to pull changes manually because you don't want to
    complicate your local version with incompatible changes from the master
    branch until you're finished with your version.  Then later you can
    merge your version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks create a separate clone repository on GitHub in your account that
    you can change things on. Clones make a copy of a repository.  Branches
    allow making changes to an existing project, but is not a fork.
    Forks are used to make a local project of someone else's work.
    Clones are used to make a local copy of an existing project.
    Branches are used to make changes on a current project.  You would use this
    instead of fork if you are able to work on the original remote repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You could be somewhere without internet and still be able to see the
    remote repository.  Also it makes it easier to see differences between
    local and remote repository by having it all on one computer.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You would use a lot of instant messenger, IRC, phone calls.  You would keep
    a lot of copies of the project and manually manage them.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
