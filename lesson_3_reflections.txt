Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might want to pull changes manually because you don't want to
    complicate your local version with incompatible changes from the master
    branch until you're finished with your version.  Then later you can
    merge your version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks create a separate clone repository on GitHub in your account that
    you can change things on. Clones make a copy of a repository.  Branches 
    allow making changes to an existing project, but is not a fork.
    Forks are used to make a local project of someone else's work.
    Clones are used to make a local copy of an existing project.
    Branches are used to make changes on a current project.  You would use this
    instead of fork if you are able to work on the original remote repository.
