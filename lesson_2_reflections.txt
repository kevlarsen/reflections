What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository it creates a hidden directory that
contains version control information.  You need to do it so the computer
knows there's a version control repository there now.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains all files that will change in the next 
'git commit'.  The value is you choose what is changed in the next commit,
rather than everything.
